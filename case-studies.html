        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As the Service Manager, I was at the forefront of this transformative initiative. My responsibilities included leading the review of Cisco maintenance costs and identifying cost-saving opportunities through a hybrid support model; collaborating with the network team to assess the state of the infrastructure and define support requirements; managing the vendor engagement process, including drafting the RFP, evaluating proposals, and negotiating contracts; engaging stakeholders across the organisation, including remote mining sites, to ensure alignment with operational needs; and overseeing the implementation of the hybrid model, monitoring its performance, and ensuring its sustainability. By balancing financial imperatives with operational needs, I delivered a solution that met cost-saving targets while preserving the reliability of the network infrastructure.
