        <h2>Redesigning Critical Incident Management</h2>
        <img src="ITSM Fundamentals_edited.jpg" alt="ITSM fundamentals for critical incident management">
        <p class="company-role">Rio Tinto, Global Service Manager</p>

        <p><strong>üß© The Challenge</strong><br>
        A global mining organisation with 57,000 employees faced operational disruptions due to an inefficient Critical Incident Management process. Existing Incident Management routines were unclear, misaligned, and lacked fatigue or vendor response planning, all of which impacted uptime.</p>

        <p><strong>üõ†Ô∏è The Solution</strong><br>
            Introduced structured categorisation, defined ownership, clear communication checkpoints, and fatigue/vendor protocols across teams.</p>

            <p><strong>üìà The Results</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster response times and reduced downtime</li>
            <li>Consistent and timely updates built stakeholder confidence</li>
            <li>Fatigue strategies led to quicker and safer resolutions</li>
            <li>Vendor engagement was improved for more efficient incident handling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ravensthorpe Technology Infrastructure Rebuild</h2>
        <p class="company-role">First Quantum Minerals, IT Manager</p>
        <p>When First Quantum Minerals acquired the Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in 2010, the site's IT infrastructure was in disarray due to the hasty exit of the previous operator. Tasked with assessing and restoring the IT environment, our team implemented a comprehensive rebuild. By reconstructing network segments, restoring critical systems, and ensuring redundancy, we delivered an IT infrastructure that enabled the mine to achieve commercial production by December 2011.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieved commercial production on December 28, 2011, meeting the project's critical timeline.</li>
            <li>Delivered a robust, secure IT infrastructure that enabled efficient mining operations.</li>
            <li>Eliminated single points of failure, ensuring operational resilience.</li>
            <li>Enhanced site safety through CCTV, access control, and reliable communication systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Optimising Satellite Communications</h2>
        <p class="company-role">First Quantum Minerals, Network Manager</p>
        <p>First Quantum Minerals relied heavily on satellite technology to enable communication across its remote African mining sites and headquarters in Perth, Australia. As the organisation grew rapidly during a commodity boom, increased traffic resulted in bandwidth saturation, deteriorating call quality, reducing operational efficiency. Tasked with solving this challenge while reducing satellite costs, our team deployed Riverbed SteelHead devices, optimised network performance, and prioritised mission-critical traffic. The results included a 68% reduction in satellite utilisation and dramatic improvements in communication reliability and speed, ensuring seamless collaboration across the organisation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced satellite utilisation by 68% over a three-month period.</li>
            <li>Decreased CIFS WAN utilisation by 98%, significantly improving file transfer efficiency.</li>
            <li>Shortened PST email file transfer times from 29 hours to 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enhanced reliability and satisfaction, with users reporting noticeable improvements in connectivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hybrid Support Model for Network Maintenance</h2>
        <p class="company-role">Rio Tinto, Service Manager</p>
        <p>In 2015, Rio Tinto faced mounting financial pressure to contribute to a company wide goal of $5 billion in savings amidst a dramatic drop in iron ore prices. During this period, a CMDB asset inventory exercise revealed a 229% increase in network maintenance costs due to previously unaccounted for assets. As the Service Manager, I led a strategic initiative to introduce a hybrid support model that combined third party maintenance with Cisco support. This innovative approach preserved critical asset protection while significantly reducing ongoing costs. The project was projected to save $1.5 million over three years, offering a sustainable and risk managed solution to a pressing financial challenge.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Projected savings of $1.5 million USD over three years, significantly reducing the financial burden on the organisation.</li>
            <li>Maintained critical asset protection with minimal disruption during the transition to the hybrid model.</li>
            <li>Enhanced visibility of network assets through updated CMDB records and streamlined maintenance processes.</li>
            <li>Secured buy-in across departments, ensuring smooth adoption of the new model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Delivering Reliable Communications for African Copper Mining Operations</h2>
        <p class="company-role">First Quantum Minerals, Lead</p>
        <p>Mining copper in Africa presents unique challenges, from rugged terrains to remote locations with limited infrastructure. In 2006 First Quantum Minerals (FQM), a global mining company, faced significant hurdles in ensuring reliable communications across its operations. At the heart of FQM's operations was the Kansanshi mine site, a key revenue generator for FQM. Reliable intersite communications were critical to relay operational data back to headquarters in London and Australia via satellites. FQM encountered frequent challenges with local telecommunications providers, including delays and a lack of prioritisation for their needs. To address these issues, FQM built their own fixed-point microwave (PTP) link, ensuring solid, dependable communications locally and globally.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved communications and reliability meant local and global operations experienced fewer disruptions and greater operational continuity.</li>
            <li>Cost Savings were obtained through a reduced reliance on local Telcos.</li>
            <li>Operational efficiency was improved as timely and accurate data exchange improved decision making and resource allocation.</li>
            <li>Scalability was key as the solution laid the foundation for future infrastructure enhancements as FQM's operations expanded.</li>
        </ul>
