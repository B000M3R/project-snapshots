        <p class="company-role">Rio Tinto, Global Service Manager</p>

        <p><strong>üß© The Challenge</strong><br>
        A global mining organisation with 57,000 employees faced operational disruptions due to an inefficient Critical Incident Management process. Existing Incident Management routines were unclear, misaligned, and lacked fatigue or vendor response planning, all of which impacted uptime.</p>

        <p><strong>üõ†Ô∏è The Solution</strong><br>
            Introduced structured categorisation, defined ownership, clear communication checkpoints, and fatigue/vendor protocols across teams.</p>

            <p><strong>üìà The Results</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster response times and reduced downtime</li>
            <li>Consistent and timely updates built stakeholder confidence</li>
            <li>Fatigue strategies led to quicker and safer resolutions</li>
            <li>Vendor engagement was improved for more efficient incident handling</li>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        When First Quantum Minerals acquired the Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in 2010, the site‚Äôs IT infrastructure was in disarray following the sudden exit of the previous operator. Tasked with restoring critical IT services, we rebuilt key network segments, restored vital systems, and implemented redundancies to ensure operational continuity and resilience.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>üß© The Challenge</strong><br>
        A dismantled IT environment, missing infrastructure, lack of firewalls, and non-functional communication systems posed major operational risks at a remote mining site.</p>
        
        <p><strong>üõ†Ô∏è The Solution</strong><br>
        Rebuilt segmented networks with robust security, restored critical services including telephony and CCTV, and deployed a resilient, redundant data centre.</p>
        
        <p><strong>üìà The Results</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Commercial production achieved by December 28, 2011, meeting critical business timelines.</li>
          <li>Eliminated single points of failure and enabled safe, efficient operations.</li>
          <li>Delivered a resilient infrastructure aligned with harsh site conditions and operational demands.</li>

        <p class="company-role">First Quantum Minerals, Network Manager</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        First Quantum Minerals relied heavily on satellite technology to enable communication across its remote African mining sites and headquarters in Perth, Australia. As the organisation grew rapidly during a commodity boom, increased traffic resulted in bandwidth saturation, deteriorating call quality, reducing operational efficiency. Tasked with solving this challenge while reducing satellite costs, our team deployed Riverbed SteelHead devices, optimised network performance, and prioritised mission-critical traffic. The results included a 68% reduction in satellite utilisation and dramatic improvements in communication reliability and speed, ensuring seamless collaboration across the organisation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>üß© The Challenge</strong><br>
        Satellite congestion, poor voice and video quality, rising bandwidth costs, and limited visibility into application performance.</p>

        <p><strong>üõ†Ô∏è The Solution</strong><br>
        Deployed Riverbed SteelHead across 14 global sites, tuned QoS settings, and prioritised essential business traffic to optimise bandwidth and improve reliability.</p>

        <p><strong>üìà The Results</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced satellite utilisation by 68% and CIFS WAN usage by 98%.</li>
            <li>Email file transfers dropped from 29 hours to just 3‚Äì4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Improved communication stability, user satisfaction, and operational agility.</li>

        <p class="company-role">Rio Tinto, Service Manager</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Amid a company-wide goal to save $5 billion, a CMDB review revealed a 229% spike in network maintenance costs. As Service Manager, I led a strategic overhaul by designing a hybrid support model that blended OEM and third-party vendors. The initiative achieved significant savings while maintaining critical infrastructure support across global operations.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>üß© The Challenge</strong><br>
        Exploding maintenance costs from newly discovered assets, resistance to third-party support, and the need to reduce costs without risking infrastructure reliability.</p>
        
        <p><strong>üõ†Ô∏è The Solution</strong><br>
        Delivered a hybrid support model using OEM for critical systems and third-party providers for non-critical assets, supported by stakeholder collaboration and vendor performance monitoring.</p>
        
        <p><strong>üìà The Results</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Projected $1.5M in savings over 3 years, ultimately exceeding targets.</li>
          <li>Maintained service continuity and asset protection with minimal disruption.</li>
          <li>Improved CMDB accuracy and gained organisation-wide support, including IOT.</li>
