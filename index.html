        <h2>Redesigning Critical Incident Management</h2>
        <p class="company-role">Rio Tinto, Global Service Manager</p>
        <p>A global mining organisation with 57,000 employees faced operational disruptions due to an inefficient Critical Incident Management (CIM) process. Delays in incident response and resolution led to costly downtime and miscommunication among stakeholders. By redesigning the CIM process to include improved categorisation, enhanced communication protocols, and fatigue management strategies, response times were significantly reduced, and operational stability improved.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster response times and reduced downtime due to improved categorisation and ownership.</li>
            <li>Consistent and timely updates enhanced stakeholder confidence and alignment.</li>
            <li>Fatigue management strategies led to quicker and safer incident resolution.</li>
            <li>Improved vendor engagement streamlined the resolution process.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <h2>Ravensthorpe Technology Infrastructure Rebuild</h2>
        <p class="company-role">First Quantum Minerals, IT Manager</p>
        <p>When First Quantum Minerals acquired the Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in 2010, the site's IT infrastructure was in disarray due to the hasty exit of the previous operator. Tasked with assessing and restoring the IT environment, our team implemented a comprehensive rebuild. By reconstructing network segments, restoring critical systems, and ensuring redundancy, we delivered an IT infrastructure that enabled the mine to achieve commercial production by December 2011.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieved commercial production on December 28, 2011, meeting the project's critical timeline.</li>
            <li>Delivered a robust, secure IT infrastructure that enabled efficient mining operations.</li>
            <li>Eliminated single points of failure, ensuring operational resilience.</li>
            <li>Enhanced site safety through CCTV, access control, and reliable communication systems.</li>
        </ul>
